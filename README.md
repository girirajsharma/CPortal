# CPortal
CPortal is an android application that acts as a front-end interface to a college information portal written in ruby on rails. It is developed 
for the automation of time table of entire college as well as for easy access of important information to associated students easily and quickly 
via push notifications on their mobile devices.

The project as a whole is still in Alpha development stage and requires lot of debugging and suggestions.Your suggestions are very valuable to us in 
improving this project as a whole and will be highly appreciated.
